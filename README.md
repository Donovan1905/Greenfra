## Introduction
Greenfra is a tool designed to help you estimate the environmental impact of the changes you make to your infrastructure using Terraform. By analyzing your local Terraform configurations, Greenfra provides insights into the potential carbon footprint of your planned resource changes.

Greenfra is currently under development.

## Features
- Estimate carbon footprint for various Terraform resources.
- Analyze local Terraform changes before applying them.
- Support for various instance types and resources.
- Easy to use command-line interface.

## Installation

Use Homebrew: 

```sh 
brew tap donovan1905/greenfra 
brew install Donovan1905/homebrew-greenfra/greenfra
```

To install Greenfra, you need to have Go installed on your system. Then, you can clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greenfra.git
cd greenfra
go build
```

Alternatively, you can use `go get` to install Greenfra directly:

```sh
go get github.com/yourusername/greenfra
```

## Usage

### Commands
Greenfra supports the following commands:

- `analyze` : Estimate the carbon footprint for EC2 changes in your terraform project.

### Flags
Greenfra supports the following flags:

- `-exec-plan` : Choose to whether or not asking greenfra to execute the terraform plan. If not used, you will need to provide a path to a terraform plan file. You can also set the environnement variable GREENFRA_EXEC_PLAN to true to alway execute terraform plan with Greenfra.

### Example Commands
Here are some example commands to use Greenfra:

- To estimate the carbon footprint of your instances without using an existing plan:
  ```sh
  greenfra -exec-plan analyze
  ```

- To estimate the carbon footprint of your instances with an already generated plan:
  ```sh
  greenfra analyze <relative path to your plan file>
  ```
