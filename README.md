## Introduction
Greenfra is a tool designed to help you estimate the environmental impact of the changes you make to your infrastructure using Terraform. By analyzing your local Terraform configurations, Greenfra provides insights into the potential carbon footprint of your planned resource changes.

Greenfra is currently under development.

## Features
- Estimate carbon footprint for various Terraform resources.
- Analyze local Terraform changes before applying them.
- Support for various instance types and resources.
- Easy to use command-line interface.

## Installation
To install Greenfra, you need to have Go installed on your system. Then, you can clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greenfra.git
cd greenfra
go build
```

Alternatively, you can use `go get` to install Greenfra directly:

```sh
go get github.com/yourusername/greenfra
```

## Usage

### Commands
Greenfra supports the following commands:

- `ec2` : Estimate the carbon footprint for specified EC2 instance types.
- `terraform` : List all the instance type in your local terraform changes
- None : combination of the two previous commands

### Flags
Greenfra supports the following flags:

- `-instance-type` : Specify the EC2 instance type to analyze. (e.g., `t3.micro`, `g4dn.xlarge`)

### Example Commands
Here are some example commands to use Greenfra:

- To get the config for a specific instance type:
  ```sh
  go run main.go -instance-type t3.micro ec2
  ```

- To list all the instance types wihin your local Terraform changes:
  ```sh
  go run main.go terraform
  ```

- To get the config for each instance type present within your local Terraform changes:
  ```sh
  go run main.go
  ```

- To display help information:
  ```sh
  go run main.go help
  ```
